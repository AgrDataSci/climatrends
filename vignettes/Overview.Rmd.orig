# Summary

Understanding how climate variability influences ecological processes is a key approach to provide recommendations for climate adaptation and biodiversity conservation. **climatrends** aims to provide the toolkit to compute extreme precipitation and temperature indices that serves as input for climate models, crop modelling, trends in climate change and ecology. The climate variables available in **climatrends** were previously used to identify climate patterns in crop growing cycles[@Kehel2016], regional climate change assessment[@Aguilar2005], crowdsourcing citizen science in agriculture[@vanEtten2019] and comparison between perceptions to climate change and satellite observations[@DeSousa2018].

# Source of data

By default **climatrends** uses [NASA POWER](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/) to compute the indices via the R package [nasapower](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nasapower)[@Sparks2018]. By providing the target dates and the geographic information, **climatrends** sends an internal call to *nasapower* to request the time series data and compute the environmental indices. This process do not requires much computer capacity but requires a persistent internet connection. NASA POWER, however, has a low grid resolution (0.5 arc-degree) and could not provide the expected results for ecological interactions in a narrow geographical range.

Other option relies in providing the climate data locally as a `matrix` or `array` (please see details below), using, for example, the function `extract()` from the package [raster](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=raster)[@Hijmans2015]. The environmental data can be computed using inputted data from CHIRPS[@Funk2015] for rainfall, and MODIS[@Wan2015] for land surface temperature. These databases are free and publicly available sources of global coverage with high resolution (0.05 arc-degree), but may require significant local storage capacity. MODIS data also requires some work to reduce noise and gap filling.

# Usage

## Temperature 

The function `temperature()` has as the basic input data an `object` of class `data.frame` with geographic information (lonlat) or an `array` with day and night temperature (when provided locally) and a vector of class `Date` for the first day that will be taken into account for the indices. The duration from where the environmental indices will be computed is defined by the argument `span` which can be a single integer that takes into account a single timespan for all tricot experiments or a vector indicating the timespan for each point.

Here we generate some random points within the Innlandet county in Norway from May-2015:

```{r temperature, message=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(6)
lonlat <- data.frame(lon = runif(5, 8.3, 12),
                     lat = runif(5, 60, 62.3))

date <- as.Date("2015-05-01", format = "%Y-%m-%d")

temp <- temperature(lonlat, day.one = date, span = 50)

head(temp)

```

With the argument `timeseries = TRUE`, `temperature()` returns the indices for a time series based on `intervals`. Here we compute the indices for intervals of 7 days:

```{r temperature2, message=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
temp2 <- temperature(lonlat,
                     day.one = date,
                     span = 50, 
                     timeseries = TRUE,
                     intervals = 7)

head(temp2)
```

## Growing degree-days 

Growing degree-days is a heuristic tool in phenology, it is a measure of heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development rates[@Prentice1992]. With the function `GDD()` we can compute the growing degree-days to assess the degree-days required by an certain organism during a certain season. Also, this index can be used as an estimate for the timespan to compute the temperature and precipitation indices. Here we compute the days to reach the growing degree-days for a certain organism which requires 200 degree-days with a `base = 5` from `day.one`:

```{r gdd, message=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
gdd <- GDD(lonlat, 
           day.one = date,
           degree.days = 200,
           base = 5)

head(gdd)
```

Then, these growing degree-days can be applied as timespan to compute the temperature indices across the season:

```{r temperature3, message=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
temp <- temperature(lonlat, 
                    day.one = date, 
                    span = gdd)

head(temp)

```


## Rainfall 

Precipitation indices are computed in the same way as the temperature indices using the function `rainfall()`. Here we use the NASA POWER data with a timespan defined by the growing degree-days.  

```{r rain, message=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
rain <- rainfall(lonlat, 
                 day.one = date,
                 span = gdd)

head(rain)
```

The function `rainfall()` also compute indices for a time series:

```{r rain2, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
rainfall(lonlat,
         day.one = date,
         span = gdd,
         timeseries = TRUE,
         intervals = 15)
```

Another feature in `rainfall()` is that it enables the indices to be calculated from some days before `day.one`. This is important for case studies where a residual precipitation must be taken into account. To do so, we use the argument `days.before`:

```{r rain3, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
rainfall(lonlat,
         day.one = date,
         span = gdd,
         days.before = 15)
```

## Evapotranspiration

Evapotranspiration can be defined as the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere. This is also an important index to include in models for ecological interactions. In **climatrends* this index can be calculate using the function `ETo()` which computes the evapotranspiration based on the Blaney-Criddle method[@Brouwer1986], an ideal equation when only air-temperature data sets are available for a site. 


```{r eto, message=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
eto <- ETo(lonlat, 
           day.one = date,
           span = gdd,
           lat = lonlat[["lat"]])

head(eto)

```

# Compute indices from local databases

When using data from local databases, such as CHIRPS or MODIS. The inputted `object` must be provided in a specific format. This is how the `object` should be organised for `rainfall()`. A matrix where column names are the days as extracted from CHIRPS. Let's create some random values to simulate the input behaviour.

```{r localrain, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(999)
rain <- matrix(runif(150, 0, 2), ncol = 15, nrow = 10)
dimnames(rain)[[2]] <- as.character(as.Date(16005:16019, origin = "1970-01-01"))

dates <- as.Date(runif(10, 16005, 16008), origin = "1970-01-01")

rainfall(rain, 
         day.one = dates,
         span = 10)
```

The same for `temperature()`. But in that case the inputted `object` is an array with two layers, the first for the day temperature and the second for the night temperature.

```{r localtemp, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(888)
day <- runif(150, 27, 35)
night <- runif(150, 20, 25)

mod <- array(c(day, night), dim = c(10, 15, 2))
dimnames(mod)[[2]] <- as.character(as.Date(16005:16019, origin = "1970-01-01"))

dates <- as.Date(runif(10, 16005, 16008), origin = "1970-01-01")

temperature(mod,
            day.one = dates,
            span = 10)
```

# Indices
