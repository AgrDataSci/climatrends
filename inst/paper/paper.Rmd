# Summary

Understand how climate variability drives ecological processes is a key approach to provide recommendations for climate adaptation and biodiversity conservation. **climatrends** aims to provide the toolkit to compute extreme precipitation and temperature indices that serves as input for climate models, crop modelling, trends in climate change and ecology. The climate variables available in **climatrends** were previously used to identify climate patterns in crop growing cycles [@Kehel2016], regional climate change assessment [@Aguilar2005], the effects of agroclimatic indices on the performance of crop varieties [@vanEtten2019] and compare perceptions to climate change with observed data [@DeSousa2018].

# Implementation


# Application: common beans


# Application: time series 

# Further development
Integration with other datasets as they become available in `R` via API client packages.
