# Summary

Understand how climate variability drives ecological processes is a key approach to provide recommendations for climate adaptation and biodiversity conservation. **climatrends** aims to provide the R [@RCoreTeam] toolkit to compute extreme precipitation and temperature indices that serves as input for climate and crop models [@vanEtten2019; @Kehel2016], trends in climate change [@Aguilar2005; @deSousa2018] and applied ecology [**add-reference**].

# Methods and features

## Implementation

Four main functions are provided, `ETo()`, `GDD()`, `rainfall()` and `temperature()` with methods [@RCoreTeam] for classes 'data.frame', 'matrix' (or array), and 'sf' [@sf]. 

# Growing degree-days

$$ GDD = \frac{}{}  $$


# Evapotranspiration


# Application: common beans

Replicate part of the analysis in van Etten et al [-@vanEtten2019] with the beans data to show how we can use this package to capture the influence of climate variability on crop performance. The idea is to show the same PlackettLuce Tree.

# Application: time series 

Pick some random points in Norway (or Scandinavia??) and check how the trends on temperature indices over the last 20 years. 


# Further development
Integration with other datasets as they become available in `R` via API client packages. New indices related to the physiology of crops to be implemented while I work on the rice data.
