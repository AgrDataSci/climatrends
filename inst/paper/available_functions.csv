Name,Function,Input,Output
crop_sensitive(),Compute crop sensitive indices ,"According to each method that can be a numeric vector (default), an array, data.frame or sf (POINT or POLYGON), the later two designed to fetch data from cloud sources",A dataframe with crop sensitive indices with n colunms depending on the number of thresholds passed to each index
Eto(),Reference evapotranspiration,"According to each method that can be a vector (default), an array, data.frame or sf (POINT or POLYGON), the later two designed to fetch data from cloud sources",The reference evapotranspiration
GDD(),Compute growing degree-days,"According to each method that can be a numeric vector (default), an array, data.frame or sf (POINT or POLYGON), the later two designed to fetch data from cloud sources","Either the cumulative sum of gdd across time (the default), or the gdd obtained in each day, or the number of days required to reach a certain amount of gdd"
late_frost(),Compute the occurrence of late-spring frost,"According to each method that can be a numeric vector (default), an array, data.frame or sf (POINT or POLYGON), the later two designed to fetch data from cloud sources","A data.frame with the duration and gdd accumulated during the events of frost, latency (where there is no frost event, but also there is no gdd), and warming (where gdd is accumulated)"
rainfall(),Precipitation indices,"According to each method that can be a numeric vector (default), a matrix, data.frame or sf (POINT or POLYGON), the later two designed to fetch data from cloud sources","Either the indices considering the series as a whole, or time series indices splitted into equal intervals of days"
temperature(),Temperature indices,"According to each method that can be a numeric vector (default), an array, data.frame or sf (POINT or POLYGON), the later two designed to fetch data from cloud sources","Either the indices considering the series as a whole, or time series indices splitted into equal intervals of days"
